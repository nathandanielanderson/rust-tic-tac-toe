## Inspiration

This project was inspired by the classic movie *WarGames* (1983), exploration of AI, games, and decision-making sparked my interest in programming and led me to write Tic-Tac-Toe whenever learning a new programming language.

Just like in *WarGames*, the AI in this game is unbeatable when played optimally. It uses a well-known maximin algorithm to ensure it either wins or forces a draw, depending on how well the player performs.
